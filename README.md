# Intersection-of-groups-of-segments-from-Phoible-data-on-Papunesia-and-Australia
This was created for a Language Typology group project. I took data from Phoible and filtered it into separate files for Papunesia and Australia. Then I made a way to compare  what languages have abc and xyz segments.
There are definitely ways to make this code faster; I was just doing this quickly and tailoring it to the specific problem I needed to solve.
